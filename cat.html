JSON.stringify() is used to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string. JSON.parse() is used to convert a JSON string into a JavaScript object. These methods are used to send and receive data in the form of JSON strings via the fetch API. The JSON.stringify() method is used to convert the data to be sent in the body of the request into a JSON string.
